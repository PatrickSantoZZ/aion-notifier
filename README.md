# tera-notifier
A watered down version of node-notifier for tera proxy. Allows modules to use windows Toasts/Balloons for notification purposes.
* Soon only for AION :)
## Infomation
- Internal Proxy Name: 'notifier'
- Occupies the global namespace using the `activeWindow` variable. See `active window` section when implementing your own modules using this as a dependency.

## Update
For Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (Build 1709 and above):

The new update to node-notifier fixed toast notification issue, but snoretoast have to be run initially when installing this module as a new module or if it has not been run before. You can run snoreToast at `tera-notifier\notifiers\vendor\snoreToast\snoreToast.exe`. Hopefully, there won't be much issues after running it for the first time, and that there is no need to do it multiple times. For those suspicious of running files VirusTotal results are [here.](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/9e8016d8552c50db2ed2b5a08a1523a258214d550aa5dd52ce566fd409c72a7e/detection)

This module have also begun using a [node addon](https://github.com/SerenTera/active-window-title) to detect if TERA is running in the foreground to determine if the user is AFK from tera or not, for the purposes of selectively notifying only if so. If any issues are found, please feel free to open a issue.

## General Infomation
I have attached a test file, `notifiertest.js` in the folder `tera-notifier\notifiers\test_module`, if you need to test, just drop this file in `bin\node_modules` folder, no need to create a subfolder for it. It will pop up a notification on desktop after logging into the server immediately, while loading the character selection screen.

READ THIS: When you Clone and download this module, RENAME the resulting folder to tera-notifier, DO NOT leave as 'tera-notifier-master' OR you can use the release version: https://github.com/SerenTera/tera-notifier/releases

## User Config
Edit config.json for user configs. Do not touch anything else.
- `notifierType`: The type of notification to use. USE ONLY `balloon` OR `toast` as the type, default is `toast`. Balloon is the old type of notifcation seen in Windows XP and below, but you can use this if toast fails.
- `processTitle`: The title of TERA window. By default, it should be "TERA". Otherwise, the title can be seen by holding alt tab and tab till the tera game window itself (not the launcher!).
- `iconfile`: The filename of the icon file in the root module folder.

## Developing modules to use tera-notifier
If you are not looking to develop other modules to use tera-notifier, then this portion is not necessary for you.

Refer to `Original readme` for all available properties you can use to craft the notification

#### Simple method
Similar to command module, simply use `.message()` or `.messageafk()` methods as examplified below:
```
module.exports = function myMod(mod) {	
    const notifier = mod.require.notifier 
    
    notifier.message('Hello world! uwu owo')  //standard instant notification
    
    notifier.messageafk('Hello world! uwu owo') //checks for afk status using defaults before notifying
}
```
- `.message('message')` : Instantly sends a notification upon being called. Default with sound and tera logo, notification is titled 'TERA'.
- `.messageafk('message')` : Checks for afk status before sending a notification upon being called. Default with sound and tera logo, notification is titled 'TERA'. 

#### Complex methods for toast (Win 8.1/10)
Use `notifier.notify()` to customize your notifications with some options available.
```
const path=require('path')   //Only if you intend to have custom icon
	
module.exports = function myMod(mod) {	
    const notifier = mod.require.notifier

    notifier.notify({
		title: 'Tera notify',
		message: 'Party message:VHHM>H/D Leader:xaxaxa(3/5)',
		icon: path.join(__dirname,'tera.png'), //Optional. Use absolute path. If not used, there will be a default tera logo.
		wait:false, 			       //False = Time out on its own. True = Stay around until 'remove' property is called.
		sound:'Notification.IM',               //Or use true for default sound. Or use false for silence.
		id:1,                                  //Useful to remove the previous notifcation when you code. Refer to this id when you call 'remove' property
     })
}
```
  
Output:

#### Complex method for afk notification
You can also use `notifier.notifyafk()` instead to notify only if the user is deemed to be afk. 
```
const path=require('path')   //Only if you intend to have custom icon
	
module.exports = function myMod(mod) {	
    const notifier = mod.require.notifier
    
    notifier.notifyafk({
	title: 'Tera notify',
	message: 'Party message:VHHM>H/D Leader:xaxaxa(3/5)',
	icon: path.join(__dirname,'tera.png'), //Optional. Use absolute path. If not used, there will be a default tera logo.
	wait:false,                            //False = Time out on its own. True = Stay around until 'remove' property is called.
	sound:'Notification.IM',               //Or use true for default sound. Or use false for silence.
	id:1,                                  //useful to remove the previous notifcation when you code. Refer to this id when you call 'remove' property
    })
```
#### For windows 7 and below
Because windows 7 does not support toast notification, balloon notification is the fallback. Thus, when using toast notification properties in you code might cause some of them to not appear when balloon notification is used as fallback on users with win7 OS. However, message, title, sound will still be around, which isn't too bad.
  
## Changes from node-notifier
- Removed examples and test folders
- Removed linux and OSx (mac) OS notifications capability (Since tera does not use it?). Commented out in index.js
- Removed Linux/OSx notification scripts
- Added dependencies to its own folder and edited the coressponding .requires() 
- Removed 'which' dependency since it is for Linux notifier only.
- Reworked index.js, reorganised file structure so that it can work with TERA Proxy without conflicts.
- Added afk detection functionality using [active-window-title](https://github.com/SerenTera/active-window-title)

## To-Do
- Debugging (probably has alot of bugs)
- Clean up the codes

## Bugs
- Remove object property does not work well yet. Try not to use this anyway
